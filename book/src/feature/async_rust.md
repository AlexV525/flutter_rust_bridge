# Async in Rust

Currently, this feature has not been supported yet. [This article](../article/async_in_rust.md) describes some workarounds, which can be useful before the function is implemented.

However, it is implementable and the flutter_rust_bridge barely has assumption that user Rust functions should be sync. Therefore, feel free to PR or create an issue asking for more details if you want it.
