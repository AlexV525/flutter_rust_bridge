/// A wrapper to transfer ownership of T to Dart.
///
/// This type is equivalent to an [`Option<Arc<T>>`]. The inner pointer may
/// be None if a nullptr is received from Dart, signifying that this pointer
/// has been disposed.
///
/// Extensions for [`sync::RwLock`] and [`sync::Mutex`] are provided.
///
/// ## Naming the inner type
///
/// When an `RustOpaque<T>` is transformed into a Dart type, T's string
/// representation undergoes some transformations to become a valid Dart type:
/// - Rust keywords (dyn, 'static, etc.) are automatically removed.
/// - ASCII alphanumerics are kept, all other characters are ignored.
///
/// ## Trait objects
///
/// Trait objects can be put behind opaque pointers. For example, this declaration can
/// be used across the FFI border:
///
/// ```rust
/// use flutter_rust_bridge::*;
/// use std::fmt::Debug;
/// use std::panic::{UnwindSafe, RefUnwindSafe};
///
/// pub struct DebugWrapper(pub RustOpaque<Box<dyn Debug>>);
///
/// // creating a DebugWrapper using the opaque_dyn macro
/// let wrap = DebugWrapper(opaque_dyn!("foobar"));
/// // it's possible to name it directly
/// pub struct DebugWrapper2(pub RustOpaque<Box<dyn Debug + Send + Sync + UnwindSafe + RefUnwindSafe>>);
/// ```
