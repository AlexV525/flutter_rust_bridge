# Manual tests

Though we have [a lot of tests and CI](../../miscellaneous/safety),
there are rare cases when manual tests serve as a complement.
This page documents these.

## Demo (Gallery)

Though we have automatic integration tests, here we discuss manual extra tests.

### Testing environments

Try to test on as many browsers as possible, e.g.

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari

### Testing procedure

* Prepare cold-start environment (see below)
* Open documentation page "demo" and play with it
* Leave and re-enter the page (s.t. non-cold-start environment), and play with it again
