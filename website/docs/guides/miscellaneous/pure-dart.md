If you want to use Rust with Dart (without Flutter),
one way is to start with
[this minimal example](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/tree/master/frb_example/dart_minimal)
and modify according to your needs.

Alternatively,
[this example](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/tree/master/frb_example/pure_dart)
may be useful (it indeed contains a lot of tests of this library).
