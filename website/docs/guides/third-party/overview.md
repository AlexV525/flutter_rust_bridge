# Overview

What if we want to use an existing third-party Rust package?
Previously, we have to specify each function signature manually; but this is no longer needed.
Now, `flutter_rust_bridge` can automatically scan a whole third party Rust crate and directly generate everything.
Of course, you are free to customize things as well.
