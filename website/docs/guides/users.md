# Who is using

As an initial version of this page,
I utilized the [GitHub "dependents" feature](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_rust_bridge/network/dependents)
(note: use the dropdown at right-top to view dependents for each of the packages in this repository),
use some [scripts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58734176/how-to-use-github-api-to-get-a-repositorys-dependents-information-in-github)
to download it,
and temporarily filtered all repositories with >=3 stars (because they can be forks; this is super coarse and should be tuned later).

This approach excludes all projects using flutter_rust_bridge if not open-source, which is a lot.
Therefore, this list is very incomplete. 

In addition, if you are using flutter_rust_bridge,
feel free to add your name to the list if you like.
